# Reliance-Stock-Price-Prediction

# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
This repository contains Python code for performing time series analysis and forecasting on financial data using various models such as VAR (Vector Autoregression), ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). The analysis is applied to stock price data of Reliance Industries Limited (RELIANCE.NS) as an example.

## Overview
Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to understand patterns and behavior in sequential data points collected over time. It involves various steps such as data preprocessing, visualization, stationarity testing, model fitting, and forecasting. In this project, we aim to apply these techniques to financial data to gain insights into stock price movements and make predictions about future price changes.

## Motivation
Financial markets are complex and dynamic, making them challenging to predict. However, by leveraging time series analysis techniques and historical data, we can uncover underlying patterns and trends that may help inform investment decisions. This project seeks to explore different models and methods for analyzing and forecasting stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and traders.

Dependencies
The code utilizes several Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. To install the required dependencies, run:

## Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Data Collection: The data for analysis is fetched using the Yahoo Finance API for a specified asset (RELIANCE.NS in this case) and time period. Alternatively, users can provide their own dataset in CSV format.

Data Cleaning: Null values are handled, and smoothing techniques such as exponential smoothing are applied to handle noise and seasonality. Outliers and anomalies may also be addressed during this step.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are created to explore the distribution of the data, identify trends, and detect seasonality or cyclic patterns.

Modeling: Three main models are implemented:

VAR (Vector Autoregression): A multivariate time series model that captures dependencies between multiple variables.
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A univariate time series model that incorporates autoregression, differencing, and moving average components.
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Extends the ARIMA model to account for seasonal variations in the data.
Validation: The trained models are validated using a validation dataset to assess their performance and accuracy in predicting future values.

Evaluation: Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to quantify the model's predictive ability.

Prediction: Finally, the models are used to make future predictions on the stock prices, which can be visualized and analyzed to inform investment decisions.
